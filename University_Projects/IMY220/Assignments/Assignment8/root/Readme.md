We will need:
-Babel
-Webpack
-Express

First we will need to initialise package.json, so run this command in the terminal
npm init package.json

We will then install express
npm install express

We will then install Babel
npm install --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env

We will also install react
npm install react react-dom

We will also install webpack
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react babel-loader webpack webpack-cli
